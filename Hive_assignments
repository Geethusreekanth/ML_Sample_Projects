From the Patent file:
1.Find the row count of the file       --17571
select count(*) from patent;

2.Remove the duplicates and then store the result in a view       --16681
create view v_dis_patent as select distinct p_id,p_subid from patent;

3.Find the patent and count of subpatent and store this result in a view. --991
create view v_patent_count as select p_id,COUNT(p_subid) from v_dis_patent group by p_id;

4.From the above VIEW,print the count(subpatent) in DESC order
select p_id,COUNT(p_subid) as patent_count from v_dis_patent group by p_id order by patent_count DESC;

5.Find the top 5 subpatent--ie from the count of subpatent
select p_id,COUNT(p_subid) as patent_count from v_dis_patent group by p_id order by patent_count DESC limit 5;

6.Find the lowest 10 subpatent?
select p_id,COUNT(p_subid) as patent_count from v_dis_patent group by p_id order by patent_count limit 10;

7.Print the patent and subpatent where COUNT(subpatent) is >=25; --206
create view v_patent_25 as select p_id,patent_count from v_patent_count where patent_count>=25;

From custom and order files:

1.Get the id,name,age,sal from custom and amt,orderid from order by joining the tables.
 select c.c_id,c.c_name,c.c_age,c.c_sal,o.o_id,o.o_amt from custom c join order o ON (c.c_id=o.o_cusid);

2.Get the id,name,address from custom and get all the details from order table 
select c.c_id,c.c_name,c.c_loc,o.* from custom c join order o ON c.c_id=o.o_cusid;

3. Get the id,name,add,amt,date where customer id is 3
select c.c_id,c.c_name,c.c_loc,o.o_date,o.o_amt from custom c join order o ON c.c_id=o.o_cusid where c.c_id=3;

4.  Get the id,name,add,amt,date where customer id is 3 and amount =3000
select c.c_id,c.c_name,c.c_loc,o.o_date,o.o_amt from custom c join order o ON c.c_id=o.o_cusid where c.c_id=3 and o.o_amt=3000;

5.Get full details of customer,date and amount from order table where customer id is max
select c.*,o.o_date,o.o_amt from custom c join order o ON c.c_id=o.o_cusid order by c.c_id desc limit 1;

6.Get the id,name of customers with customer id is 3;(here we get a duplicate result so to avoid that we use distinct in the query)
select distinct c.c_id,c.c_name from custom c join order o ON c.c_id=o.o_cusid where c.c_id=3;

7.get name age,add and date from the latest date
 select c.c_name,c.c_age,c.c_loc,o.o_date from custom c join order o ON (c.c_id=o.o_cusid) order by o.o_date desc limit 1;

8.get name age,add,amount and date of the customers who have paid the least amount.
select c.c_name,c.c_age,c.c_loc,o.o_date,o.o_amt from custom c join order o ON (c.c_id=o.o_cusid) order by o.o_amt limit 1;


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use student and result files:
----------------------------------
1.find row count of student --20
 select COUNT(*) from student;

2.Find row count of result --20
 select COUNT(*) from result;

3.get the name and roll number of students who has passed.
select s.name,s.id from student s join result r ON (s.id=r.id) where res='pass';

left outer join
-------------------
4.get id,and corresponding customer id  count from the left outer join result
select c.c_id,count(c.c_id) from custom c left outer join order o ON (c.c_id=o.o_cusid) group by c.c_id;

5.get id,and corresponding customer id  count from the left outer join result and put the count(id) as desc
select c.c_id,count(*) as r from custom c left outer join order o ON (c.c_id=o.o_cusid) group by c.c_id order by r desc;

right outer join
-----------------
6.Get the customer details from the right table where the purchasing date is latest
select c.c_id,c.c_name,o.o_amt,o.o_date from custom c right outer join order o ON (c.c_id=o.o_cusid) order by o.o_date desc limit 1;

7.get the customer details from the right table who have payed the lowest amount 

8.get the customer details having a row in the right table where customer id >=2 salary >=4500
select c.c_id,c.c_name,c.c_sal,o.o_amt,o.o_date from custom c right outer join order o ON (c.c_id=o.o_cusid) where c.c_id>=2 and c.c_sal>=4500;

full outer join
------------------
1.find the row count of both custom and order tables together.
